# Ryan Batubara's CV

My curriculum vitae in LaTeX. The resume template is [moderncv](https://ctan.org/pkg/moderncv).

## 🛠️ How to use

> I have no idea why anyone but myself would want to build this CV from source.

1. Go to [moderncv](https://ctan.org/pkg/moderncv) and download the template files.
2. Move all the `.sty` and config files to the common latex directory of your device.
3. Do not use `pdflatex`. Use `lualatex` instead.
